-  unorder_set<int> name;
- It takes only non dupilacate element in it and reject the duplicate element.
- count is nice function which tells if the number is there in list or not...

Hey! No worries at all—you're **not dumb**. Hash sets can be confusing at first, but I got you. Let’s take it **step-by-step** and break it down with real examples, visuals (conceptual), and when to use them in problem-solving.

---

## 🔹 What is a **HashSet**?

A **HashSet** is a data structure that:

- Stores **unique elements** (no duplicates).
    
- Has **fast insert, delete, and lookup** operations—**average O(1)** time.
    
- Is **unordered** — it doesn’t keep the order of insertion.
    

In **C++**, the equivalent of a **HashSet** is:

```cpp
#include <unordered_set>
```

It’s part of the **Standard Template Library (STL)**.

---

## 🔹 Think of it like...

Imagine a **bag** where you can throw in any object, but the bag **automatically rejects duplicates** and **doesn’t care about the order**.

```cpp
unordered_set<int> mySet;
```

Now this `mySet` is your **hash set**.

---

## 🔹 How to Use `unordered_set` in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    unordered_set<int> mySet;

    // Inserting elements
    mySet.insert(10);
    mySet.insert(20);
    mySet.insert(30);
    mySet.insert(10);  // This will be ignored because 10 already exists

    // Printing elements
    for (int x : mySet)
        cout << x << " ";  // Output: could be 10 20 30 (unordered)

    // Checking if an element exists
    if (myset.count(x)) {
        cout << "\nFound 20" << endl;
    }

    // Removing an element
    mySet.erase(30);

    return 0;
}
```

---

## 🔹 Why is it called **Hash** set?

Because it uses **hashing internally**:

- Every element is converted into a **hash code**.
    
- It uses that code to **store or find** the element **super fast**.
    

---

## 🔹 When should you use `unordered_set`?

Any time you want to:

- Keep a set of **unique items**.
    
- **Quickly check** if an item exists.
    
- Not care about the order.
    

---

## 🔸 🔍 Let's Solve a Real Problem:

### Problem: Remove duplicates from a list

```cpp
vector<int> nums = {4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3};
```

We want to keep only **unique numbers**.

```cpp
unordered_set<int> seen;
for (int num : nums) {
    seen.insert(num);  // will ignore duplicates
}

for (int n : seen)
    cout << n << " ";  // Output: 1 2 3 4 (unordered)
```

---

## 🔸 💡 Another Example: Check for Duplicates

```cpp
vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3};

unordered_set<int> seen;

bool hasDuplicate = false;

for (int n : nums) {
    if (seen.find(n) != seen.end()) {
        hasDuplicate = true;
        break;
    }
    seen.insert(n);
}

if (hasDuplicate)
    cout << "Duplicate found!" << endl;
else
    cout << "All elements are unique!" << endl;
```

---

## 🔸 Visual Idea of HashSet (conceptually)

```
Input: [4, 2, 4, 3]

Insert:
→ 4 → {4}
→ 2 → {4, 2}
→ 4 → already exists, skip
→ 3 → {4, 2, 3}

Final Set: {4, 2, 3}
```

---

## 🔹 Summary

|Operation|Complexity|
|---|---|
|`insert(x)`|O(1) avg|
|`find(x)`|O(1) avg|
|`erase(x)`|O(1) avg|
|`size()`|O(1)|

✅ Use `unordered_set` when:

- You want **fast search**
    
- You want **no duplicates**
    
- You **don’t care about order**

If you want, I can give you:

- Practice problems
    
- Visual animations
    
- Comparison with `set` (which is ordered but slower)
